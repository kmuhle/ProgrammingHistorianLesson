    "Measuring how often a word appears in digitized collections gives us a concrete way to see how public interest in a topic rises and falls over time. By querying the DPLA API for the number of times a term appears in each decade, we can get answers for different cultural questions like \"When did mentions of “suffrage” surge in public discourse?\", or \"How has interest in “jazz” changed over the years?\"\n",
